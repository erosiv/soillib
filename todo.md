Live-Viewer:
- Tesselated Terrain Rendering
- SSAO in Viewer (Optional)

Relief-Shader:
- Iso-Line Image Output
- ???

TinyEngine needs improvements as well...

IO:
- TIFF Should be a variant, auto-detect size
- GEOTIFF Merging Program Should Exist. Should have a UI
	- Ideally Written in Python
- Images should be able to load at a sub-resolution
	- This means we don't have to load the whole thing!!!
	- OpenGL Textures should operate more nicely with these!!!
